Here are the main issues in your current SmartQuiz app based on the screenshots and your goal:

⸻

🔴 1. No Review Page After Quiz Completion
	•	After finishing a quiz, you land on a “No questions available” screen.
	•	You should instead see:
	•	Which questions were correct ✅
	•	Which were wrong ❌
	•	What answer you selected vs. the correct one
	•	Missing feedback defeats the purpose of practice.

⸻

🟠 2. No Option to Retry Wrong Questions
	•	There’s no feature to:
	•	Retry only the questions you got wrong
	•	Learn by repetition
	•	This makes the app less useful for targeted learning and revision.

⸻

🔴 3. Sessions Lack Navigation and Resumability
	•	Once started, you can’t:
	•	Go back to previous questions
	•	Resume an incomplete session from where you left off
	•	You’re stuck in a linear one-way flow.

⸻

🟠 4. Questions Not Persistently Stored
	•	Questions appear to be loaded in-memory only (from JSON at startup or hardcoded).
	•	You can’t:
	•	Add new questions via interface
	•	Edit or delete questions after loading
	•	Maintain chapters as growing content

⸻

🟠 5. Session Stats Are Shallow
	•	You only see:
	•	Score (or “In progress”)
	•	Total questions
	•	You’re missing:
	•	Which questions were answered
	•	Time taken per question
	•	Navigation to detailed review
	•	Retry options per session

⸻

🟡 6. No State-Aware Question Flow
	•	You can’t:
	•	Mark a question for later review
	•	Skip and return
	•	Practice by difficulty or by tag (even if you don’t need this now, architecture doesn’t support it)

⸻

🟠 7. No Question Input Interface
	•	You have no clean UI to:
	•	Upload a .json file
	•	Paste/import raw questions
	•	Organize by topic/chapter

⸻
